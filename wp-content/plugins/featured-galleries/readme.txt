Do you like giving posts a Featured Image? Try out a Featured Gallery. It's like a Featured Images ... except as many images as you want.

== Description ==

= Hello Theme Developers! =

Have you ever added a Featured Image to a post and thought to yourself, "I wish I could add more than one image this way"? Well, now you can. Featured Galleries mirrors the Featured Images functionality of WordPress. The only difference is that posts get an entire gallery rather than just a single image. These galleries behave almost exactly like Featured Images, and make use of  WordPress's built in Media Manager. Users can select images, define the order, and save the gallery, all through a simple drag-n-drop interface.

**Note**: This plugin DOES NOT HANDLE THE FRONTEND HTML CREATION. That is left for themes to handle, to allow for maximum flexibility. Featured Galleries just handles the backend/admin interface for creating featured galleries and storing them as metadata. You will need to integrate this into your theme, or use a theme with prebuilt integration.

= Quick Start Guide to Integrate Into Themes =

*For more information, see [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Kelderic/featured-galleries/wiki)*.

I've tried to make this as intuitive as possible. Themes can integrate Featured Galleries in the same way they integrate Featured Images. Inside any template file where the gallery should appear, the theme will call the [`get_post_gallery_ids()`](https://github.com/Kelderic/featured-galleries/wiki/get_post_gallery_ids) function. As long as it is used inside the loop, the function doesn't need any parameters. By default, it will return an array of image IDs.

= Example =

Set inside the Loop. This returns all images in the Featured Gallery, as an array, then loops through to display each using an HTML `<img>` tag.

    $galleryArray = get_post_gallery_ids(); 

    foreach ( $galleryArray as $id ) {

        echo '<img src="' . wp_get_attachment_url( $id ) .'">';

    }

You can also customize the returned value from the function to suit your needs. See the full [function documentation](https://github.com/Kelderic/featured-galleries/wiki/get_post_gallery_ids) page for details.

= Custom Post Types =

The plugin comes with a filter to easily add Featured Galleries to custom post types. See the [`fg_post_types`](https://github.com/Kelderic/featured-galleries/wiki/fg_post_types) documentation page for details.

= Customizing the Media Manager =

The media manager can be customized in sevearl ways. See the [`fg_show_sidebar`](https://github.com/Kelderic/featured-galleries/wiki/fg_show_sidâ„®bar) and [`fg_use_legacy_selection`](https://github.com/Kelderic/featured-galleries/wiki/fg_use_legacy_selection) filter documentation pages for details.

= Want to Help? =

I'd love some help with internationalization. It was working at one point, but drivingralle did that code because I don't really understand it, and I'm not sure it's still working.

== Installation ==

There are two ways to install this plugin.

Manual:

1. Upload the `featured-galleries` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Go to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, find 'Featured Galleries' in the list, and select 'Activate'.

Through the WP Repository:

1. Go to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, click on the 'Add New' button.
2. Search for 'Featured Galleries'. Click 'Install Now'.
3. Return to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, find 'Featured Galleries' in the list, and select 'Activate'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the point of this? =

I was tasked to update a Featured Projects page for a client website. Projects were a custom post type, and the page displaying them used a special WP_Query. Each Project had a featured image. The client wanted each to have several images that could be clicked through with arrows. I couldn't find an easy way to accomplish this, so I built it from scratch. A friend suggested I abstract it into a plugin to share.

= Will it be improved? =

Yes. The next step on my roadmap is to figure out how to do a one time re-keying of all data to start with an underscore, so that it's invisible.

= Can I add a featured gallery to my custom post type? =

Why yes you can! You don't even have to edit the plugin to do so. There are details on how to do this in the Instructions.

== Screenshots ==

1. Initial metabox, no images in the gallery.
2. Metabox with images selected and added.
